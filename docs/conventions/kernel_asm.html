			<h1 class="toc-exclude">Assembly Conventions</h1>
			<p>
				Conventions that assembly code in the kernel follows. Knowing
				these will make reading kernel assembly a lot easier.
			</p>

			<h2>AAPCS Register Saving</h2>
			<p>
				AAPCS (or at least as much of it as i understand) specifies
				that
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Registers <code>r0-r1</code> are the result registers
					(where the return value goes).
				</li>
				<li>
					Registers <code>r0-r3</code> are argument registers
					(where the first function arguments go)
				</li>
				<li>
					Registers <code>r4-r11</code> are callee-saved registers
					(the function being called needs to save the values of
					these registers before using them, and the caller can
					assume that the values in these registers will not change
					after a function has been called)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				It is important to follow these rules so that assembly and C
				code can interact with one another.
			</p>

			<h2>Stack Frames</h2>
			<!-- TODO: write alt text for this image (i have no clue how to do that) -->
			<img src="/esoterix/img/stack_frame.webp" width="30%" />
			<p>
				The above image visualizes how stack frames work. The ARM ABI
				specifies that r4-r11 are callee-saved registers, however you
				only need to save the ones which you use. Saving fewer
				registers can result in smaller stack frames and thus less
				memory usage.
			</p>
			<p>
				After stack frame initialization, <code>sp</code> should point
				to the beginning of the function stack, and <code>fp</code>
				should point to the beginning of function locals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initializing a stack frame might look something like this.
				If the function takes arguments on the stack (i.e. has
				more than 4 parameters) then you should store the initial
				value of <code>sp</code> before initializing the stack frame.
			</p>
<pre>
push {r3}
mov r3,sp
push {&lt;general registers&gt;, fp, lr}
mov fp,sp
add sp,sp,&lt;size of locals&gt;
</pre>
			<p>
				Depending on the number of fixed arguments, a variadic function
				in assembly might want to push the unused argument registers
				onto the stack before initializing the stack frame.
			</p>
<pre>
push {&lt;unused argument registers&gt;}
mov r0,sp
push {&lt;general registers&gt;, fp, lr}
mov fp,sp
add sp,sp,&lt;size of locals&gt;
</pre>
			<p>
				Cleaning up a stack frame might look like this.
			</p>
<pre>
sub sp,sp,&lt;size of locals&gt;
pop {&lt;general registers&gt;, fp, lr}
</pre>
			<p>
				In cases where you return immediately after cleaning up the
				stack frame, you can replace <code>lr</code> with
				<code>pc</code> in the <code>pop</code> instruction.
			</p>
<pre>
sub sp,sp,&lt;size of locals&gt;
pop {&lt;general registers&gt;, fp, pc}
</pre>

			<h2>Return</h2>
			<p>
				All functions written in assembly should put all appropriate
				cleanup code at the end of the function, with the numeric label
				<code>0</code>. The label <code>0</code> should never be used
				anywhere else. This means that returning can be done by
				branching to <code>0f</code>. Branching to <code>0b</code> is
				never valid.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cleanup code after label <code>0</code> is not allowed to
				modify <code>r0</code> or <code>r1</code>, so a return code may
				be set by setting these two values.
			</p>

			<h2>Comments</h2>
			<p>
				Comments in assembly source files (.S) are made using
				<code>@</code>. Comments in C header files should be C-style
				multiline or C++ style single line comments, even in the
				assembly-specific parts of the header files and even next to
				assembly code embedded in header files.
			</p>
