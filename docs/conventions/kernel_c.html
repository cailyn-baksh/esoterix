			<h2>Header files</h2>
			<p>
				C-standard header files should be included before kernel
				headers are included. Keep in mind that only a limited subset
				of standard headers are available since there is no standard
				library provided.
			</p>
			<p>
				Standard headers should also only be included using angle
				brackets, and kernel headers should only be included using
				double quotes.
			</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

#include "some_header.h"
</pre>
			<p>
				Header files will be written to be 100% compatible with both
				C and assembly. Header files which include code only compatible
				with one or the other should define that code in a language
				specific section. Language specific sections are always defined
				the same way, by checking if the macro
				<code>__ASSEMBLER__</code> is defined. Even if there is no
				assembly-specific code in the header file it should still use
				<code>ifdef</code> to prevent confusion in other headers.
			</p>
<pre>
#ifdef __ASSEMBLER__
/* asm-specific */
#else
/* C-specific */
#endif  // __ASSEMBLER__
</pre>

			<p>
				Headers which declare variables, constants, or functions as
				<code>extern</code> should only include those declarations if
				the macro <code>NOEXTERN</code> is not defined.
			</p>
<pre>
#ifndef NOEXTERN
/* extern declarations go here */
#endif  // NOEXTERN
</pre>
			<p>
				Source files which define symbols declared as extern in the
				header files can then define <code>NOEXTERN</code> before
				including the header files. <code>NOEXTERN</code> should be
				undefined after the header files are included, and includes
				marked as <code>NOEXTERN</code> should come after regular
				includes.
			</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

#include "some_header.h"
#include "another_header.h"

#define NOEXTERN
#include "header_with_externs.h"
#undef NOEXTERN
