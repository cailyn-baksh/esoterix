					<h2>Virtual Machine</h2>
					<p>
						To achieve the goal of only executing esoteric languages, Esoterix runs all executables
						in an esoteric virtual machine.

					<h2>Assembly Language</h2>
					<p>
						The Esoterix virtual machine is designed to allow for a wide range of programs to
						be written for it in esoteric languages, as well as to allow for system utilities,
						processes, and drivers to be developed on it. Since most esoteric languages are not
						designed with device drivers and the like in mind, it is necessary to use an assembly
						language to harness every feature of the virtual machine. This document details the
						instructions in that language.
